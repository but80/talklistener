Go bindings for the libsox sound library

* For more information and documentation for SoX: http://sox.sourceforge.net/

## Description

`libsox` is a library of sound sample file format readers/writers and
sound effects processors. It is mainly developed for use by `SoX` but is
useful for any sound application.

`SoX` reads and writes audio files in most popular formats and can
optionally apply effects to them. It can combine multiple input
sources, synthesise audio, and, on many systems, act as a general
purpose audio player or a multi-track audio recorder. It also has
limited ability to split the input into multiple output files.
